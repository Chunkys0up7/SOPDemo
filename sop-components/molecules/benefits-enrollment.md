# Benefits Enrollment Procedure

## Overview

This procedure guides new employees through the benefits enrollment process during their first 30 days.

## Timeline

**Important**: Benefits enrollment must be completed within **30 days of hire date**. Missing this deadline may result in waiting until the next open enrollment period.

## Step 1: Review Benefits Information

{{include: benefits-overview}}

## Step 2: Determine Your Needs

### Medical Insurance Decision Tree

**Do you have dependents?**

- **Yes** → Consider family plan coverage
- **No** → Individual coverage may be sufficient

**Do you have existing coverage?**

- **Yes** → Compare plans, consider waiving if better coverage exists
- **No** → Enrollment required

**Expected medical needs**:

- **High** (chronic conditions, planned procedures) → Low deductible plan
- **Medium** (occasional visits) → Mid-tier plan
- **Low** (young, healthy) → High deductible plan with HSA

### 401(k) Decision

**Minimum recommended**: Contribute at least **6%** to receive full company match

Example:

- Salary: $60,000
- Your contribution (6%): $3,600/year
- Company match (3%): $1,800/year
- **Free money**: $1,800/year

### Additional Coverage

Consider opting in for:

- Life insurance beyond company-provided (if you have dependents)
- Short-term disability (if savings < 6 months expenses)
- FSA/HSA for tax-advantaged healthcare savings
