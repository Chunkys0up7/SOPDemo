## Appraisal Ordering Process

### Step 1: Determine Appraisal Requirements

#### Appraisal Required For
✓ Purchase transactions (all loan types)
✓ Rate-term refinance without appraisal waiver
✓ Cash-out refinance
✓ Properties >$1,000,000
✓ Investment properties
✓ Manufactured homes
✓ Properties in declining markets

- Sales price (if purchase)
- Property type (SFR, condo, 2-4 unit, etc.)
- Rush order (if needed)
- Special instructions (FHA case #, VA case #, specific property concerns)

**Appraisal Forms by Property Type:**

| Property Type | FNMA/FHLMC Form | FHA Form |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1-Unit SFR | 1004 (URAR) | 1004 (URAR) |
| 2-4 Unit | 1025 | 1025 |
| Condo | 1073 | 1073 |
| Manufactured | 1004C | 1004C |
| Exterior-Only | 2055 | N/A (not allowed) |

**Timeline Requirements:**
- **Conventional**: Order within 3 days of application
- **FHA/VA**: Order after case number assigned
- **Rush**: 3-5 business days
- **Standard**: 7-10 business days
- **Complex**: 10-14 business days

### Step 3: Appraiser Assignment

**AMC (Appraisal Management Company) Responsibilities:**

- Verify appraiser competency for property type/location
- Ensure appraiser independence (no conflicts of interest)
- Maintain appraiser panel quality

**Verify Appraiser Qualifications:**
✓ State license/certification valid and current
✓ No disciplinary actions or suspensions
✓ Competent for property type (manufactured, complex, rural, etc.)
✓ Familiar with subject property market area

**Prohibited Actions (Appraisal Independence):**
❌ Requesting specific value or minimum value
❌ Withholding payment based on value conclusion
❌ Providing comparables to appraiser (unless requested)
❌ Ordering appraisal directly from appraiser (must use AMC)
❌ Conditioning loan approval on specific value

## Appraisal Review Process

### Phase 1: Initial Receipt and Completeness Check

**Upon Receipt:**
1. Log appraisal in LOS (Loan Origination System)
2. Upload to secure document management
3. Send copy to borrower within 3 business days (ECOA requirement)

**Completeness Checklist:**
```
Document Completeness:
  ✓ Appraiser signature and date
  ✓ Appraiser license number
  ✓ Effective date of appraisal
  ✓ Subject property photos (exterior, street scene, interior if required)
  ✓ Comparable sales photos
  ✓ Location map
  ✓ Sketch of improvements with GLA calculation
  ✓ All required addenda
  ✓ Certificate of compliance (FHA, if applicable)
  ✓ FNMA Form 1004MC (Market Conditions)
  ✓ Appraiser independence certification
```

**If Incomplete:**
- Document deficiencies
- Request revision through AMC (not directly to appraiser)
- Set 48-hour deadline for response

### Phase 2: Property Description and Data Verification

**Step 1: Verify Subject Property Information**
```
Property Address:
  ✓ Matches loan application exactly
  ✓ Legal description accurate
  ✓ Tax parcel ID matches assessor records

Property Characteristics:
  ✓ GLA (Gross Living Area) reasonable for property type
  ✓ Room count matches MLS/listing (if purchase)
  ✓ Age and condition described accurately
  ✓ Site size appropriate
  ✓ Zoning allows residential use
```

**Step 2: Review Site Section**
```
✓ Adverse site conditions identified (flood zone, busy road, commercial adjacent)
✓ Access to property adequate (public road, easement if private)
✓ Utilities available (water, sewer, electric, gas)
✓ Easements disclosed and impact assessed
```

**Step 3: Improvements Analysis**
```
Foundation:
  ✓ Type described (slab, crawl, basement)
  ✓ No evidence of settlement or cracking

Exterior:
  ✓ Siding type and condition
  ✓ Roof type, age, and remaining life
  ✓ Windows and doors condition

Interior:
  ✓ Flooring types
  ✓ Kitchen and bath condition/quality
  ✓ Heating/cooling systems
  ✓ Adequate electrical and plumbing

Condition Rating:
  C1 (New): <1 year
  C2 (Excellent): Recently renovated, minimal wear
  C3 (Good): Well maintained, normal wear
  C4 (Average): Normal wear, minor deferred maintenance
  C5 (Fair): Obvious deferred maintenance, functional issues
  C6 (Poor): Substantial damage, possible safety hazards
```

**Minimum Property Standards:**
- FHA: C4 or better (C5/C6 require repairs to close)
- VA: C4 or better
- Conventional: C5 acceptable with compensating factors

### Phase 3: Sales Comparison Approach Review

**Step 1: Verify Comparable Selection**

**Ideal Comparable Characteristics:**
```
Location:
  ✓ Same subdivision (preferred)
  ✓ Within 1 mile of subject (urban/suburban)
  ✓ Within 5 miles (rural areas)
  ✓ Same school district (if possible)

Physical Characteristics:
  ✓ GLA within 10% of subject
  ✓ Same bedroom/bathroom count (±1 acceptable)
  ✓ Same property type (SFR, condo, etc.)
  ✓ Similar age (±10 years preferred)
  ✓ Similar condition and quality

Sale Date:
  ✓ Sold within 6 months (ideal)
  ✓ Within 12 months acceptable if market stable
  ✓ Adjustments if market changing
```

**Minimum Comparable Requirements:**
- **3 closed comparables** (required)
- **Sales date**: <12 months (prefer <6 months)
- **Distance**: Closest available
- **Listings/pendings**: For market support only (not primary comps)

**Red Flags - Inferior Comparables:**
❌ All comparables >1 year old
❌ All comparables >5 miles away (urban)
❌ GLA variance >20%
❌ No comparables in same subdivision when available
❌ Using foreclosures/REO when arm's-length sales available
❌ Comparable condition significantly better/worse than subject

**Step 2: Review Adjustments**

**Acceptable Adjustment Categories:**
```
Location Adjustments:
  - Different subdivisions
  - Busy street vs quiet street
  - Golf course/waterfront premium
  - School district differences

Physical Adjustments:
  - GLA ($ per square foot)
  - Bedroom/bathroom count
  - Garage spaces
  - Basement (finished vs unfinished)
  - Lot size differences
  - Pool, deck, patio
  - Upgrades (granite, hardwood, etc.)

Market Conditions:
  - Time adjustments if market appreciating/depreciating
  - Typical: 0.5% per month in appreciating market
```

**Adjustment Guidelines:**
```
Individual Adjustment Limits:
  Line Item: $15,000 or 15% (whichever less)
  GLA: $25-75/sq ft (market dependent)

Total Adjustments (per comparable):
  Gross: <25% of sale price (FNMA guideline)
  Net: <15% of sale price (preferred)

If adjustments excessive:
  ✓ Question comparable selection
  ✓ Request different comparables if available
  ✓ Verify adjustment amounts supported
```

**Step 3: Validate Comparable Sales Data**

**Data Verification:**
```
For Each Comparable:
  ✓ Verify sale price (MLS or public records)
  ✓ Confirm sale date
  ✓ Verify GLA (MLS, assessor, or measuring service)
  ✓ Check for concessions (seller credits, financing incentives)
  ✓ Arm's-length transaction (not family, foreclosure terms disclosed)
```

**Sources for Verification:**
- MLS listing data
- County assessor/recorder records
- Public property databases (Zillow, Realtor.com for confirmation)
- Prior appraisal (if recent)

**If Data Doesn't Match:**
- Contact AMC for appraiser clarification
- Request correction if error confirmed
- Accept if appraiser provides explanation (assessor records outdated, etc.)

### Phase 4: Value Reconciliation Review

**Step 1: Analyze Value Range**
```
Comparable 1 Adjusted Price:   $XXX,XXX
Comparable 2 Adjusted Price:   $XXX,XXX
Comparable 3 Adjusted Price:   $XXX,XXX

Value Range:                    $XXX,XXX - $XXX,XXX
Appraised Value:               $XXX,XXX

Value Range Spread:
  Ideal: <5%
  Acceptable: <10%
  Concerning: >10% (requires explanation)
```

**Step 2: Value Conclusion Analysis**
```
Appraised Value Position:
  ✓ Should be within range of adjusted comparables
  ✓ Closer to best comparable (most similar, recent, close)
  ✓ Reasonable reconciliation explanation

Red Flags:
  ❌ Value above all adjusted comparables (without justification)
  ❌ Value below all adjusted comparables
  ❌ Wide value range (>10%) without explanation
  ❌ Reconciliation relies heavily on weakest comparable
```

**Step 3: Purchase Transaction Comparison**

**If Purchase Contract:**
```
Sales Price:                   $XXX,XXX
Appraised Value:              $XXX,XXX
Variance:                      $X,XXX (X.X%)

Evaluate:
  < 5% above: Normal (no concern)
  5-10% above: Scrutinize comparables, adjustments
  >10% above: High risk - likely requires ROV or new appraisal
  Below sales price: Acceptable (borrower must bring difference)
```

**Value Below Contract:**
- Acceptable - Borrower increases down payment OR seller reduces price
- Notify loan officer and borrower immediately
- Document value shortfall and options

**Value Significantly Above Contract (>10%):**
- May indicate inflated sales price or appraisal issue
- Review comparable selection and adjustments carefully
- Consider requesting Reconsideration of Value (downward) if risk identified
- Acceptable if supported and borrower equity is reasonable

### Phase 5: Condition and Repair Requirements

**FHA/VA Required Repairs:**

**Health & Safety Issues** (must repair to close):
```
❌ Peeling/chipping paint (properties built <1978)
❌ Missing handrails on stairs
❌ Non-functioning heating system
❌ Electrical hazards (exposed wiring, missing cover plates)
❌ Plumbing leaks or non-functional systems
❌ Broken windows
❌ Damaged/missing roof covering
❌ Structural damage or foundation issues
```

**Process:**
1. Appraiser notes deficiencies on appraisal
2. Obtain repair estimates
3. Repairs completed by licensed contractor
4. Re-inspection to verify completion (Form 1004D or appraiser re-visit)
5. Invoice and photos submitted to file

**FHA Repair Escrow** (if minor repairs <$5,000):
- 110% of repair estimate held in escrow
- Repairs completed within 90 days of closing
- Re-inspection verifies completion
- Funds released to contractor

**Conventional Repairs:**
- Generally not required unless affecting value or marketability
- Lender may require if significant safety/structural concerns

### Phase 6: Special Property Types

#### Condominiums

**Additional Review Requirements:**
```
✓ HOA certification (Form 1076)
✓ Project approval status (FNMA, FHA, VA)
✓ Owner-occupancy ratio ≥51%
✓ No single entity owns >10% of units
✓ HOA financially sound (review budget/reserves)
✓ No deferred maintenance to common areas
✓ No ongoing litigation (or acceptable resolution)
```

**Appraisal Form:** 1073 (Condo appraisal)
**Additional Addenda:** PUD/Condo addendum

#### 2-4 Unit Properties

**Additional Requirements:**
```
✓ Rental income analysis (Schedule E from tax returns)
✓ Market rent comparison (Form 1007)
✓ Individual unit descriptions
✓ Condition of all units assessed (exterior inspection minimum)
✓ Zoning allows multi-family
```

**Appraisal Form:** 1025 (Multi-family)
**Income Approach:** Required for 2-4 unit (in addition to sales comparison)

#### Manufactured Homes

**Additional Requirements:**
```
✓ HUD certification label present (post-1976)
✓ Permanently affixed to foundation
✓ Titled as real property (not personal property)
✓ Minimum dimensions: 400 sq ft, 12 ft wide
✓ Comparable sales of manufactured homes (preferred)
```

**Appraisal Form:** 1004C (Manufactured Home)

#### Rural Properties

**Additional Considerations:**
```
✓ Larger comparable search radius acceptable (5-10 miles)
✓ Older comparable sales acceptable if market stable (12-18 months)
✓ Well and septic system functional and permitted
✓ Road access adequate (paved or maintained gravel)
✓ Acreage appropriately valued
```

## Market Conditions Analysis (Form 1004MC)

**Required for All Appraisals:**
- FNMA Form 1004MC (Market Conditions Addendum)
- Analyzes 12-month sales trends in subject neighborhood

**Key Metrics to Review:**
```
Inventory Analysis:
  - Months of supply (≤6 = seller's market, ≥6 = buyer's market)
  - Absorption rate

Price Trends:
  - Median sale price trend (increasing/stable/declining)
  - Days on market trend

Market Conclusion:
  ✓ Appraiser classifies as: Stable, Declining, or Increasing
  ✓ Supports or contradicts time adjustments used
  ✓ Indicates market risk for collateral
```

**Declining Market Red Flags:**
❌ Increasing inventory (>6 months supply)
❌ Median price declining >5%
❌ Days on market increasing significantly
❌ High foreclosure/REO concentration

**Actions for Declining Market:**
- Use most recent comparables available (<6 months)
- Scrutinize appraised value vs. recent pendings
- Consider additional comparable verification
- Document market risk in file

## Appraisal Issues and Resolution

### Reconsideration of Value (ROV) Requests

**Valid Reasons for ROV:**
- Factual errors in appraisal (incorrect GLA, bedroom count, etc.)
- Comparable sales data incorrect
- Better comparable sales available (more recent, closer, more similar)
- Appraisal did not consider recent upgrades/renovations

**ROV Process:**
1. **Borrower submits ROV request** with supporting documentation
2. **Review request for validity** - Must provide specific factual errors or better data
3. **Submit to AMC with specific questions** - Do not ask for specific value
4. **Appraiser responds** - May issue revised appraisal, rebuttal, or no change
5. **Document outcome** in file

**Invalid ROV Requests:**
❌ "We just don't agree with the value"
❌ "Zillow shows higher value"
❌ Providing opinion of value without factual basis
❌ Requesting value to meet sales price

**Timeline:**
- ROV request submitted: Within 5 days of receiving appraisal
- Appraiser response: 5-7 business days
- May delay closing - set expectations with borrower

### Field Review Appraisal

**Order When:**
- Appraised value questionable
- Comparable selection poor
- Excessive or inappropriate adjustments
- Property in declining market with value concerns
- Investor requires (high-risk loans)

**Process:**
- Second appraiser visits property and reviews first appraisal
- Provides opinion on accuracy and appropriateness
- May support or contradict original value
- More expensive ($500-750 vs standard $400-500)

### New Appraisal

**Order When:**
- Original appraisal has material deficiencies that cannot be corrected
- Value is clearly unsupported and ROV unsuccessful
- Property has changed significantly (repairs, damage)
- Borrower requests and pays for second opinion

**Requirements:**
- Different appraiser (avoid conflicts)
- Disclose first appraisal exists (appraisal independence)
- Use lowest value if both acceptable
